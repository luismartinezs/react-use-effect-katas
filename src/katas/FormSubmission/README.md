# Handle Concurrent Form Submissions

Welcome to the "Handle Concurrent Form Submissions" kata! This exercise is designed to help you understand how to manage multiple form submissions in React, ensuring that only the latest submission is processed. This is particularly useful in scenarios where network delays might cause responses to arrive out of order.

## Learning Objectives:

- Use `useState` and `useRef` hooks to manage form state and track the latest submission.
- Implement a custom hook to encapsulate form submission logic.
- Handle asynchronous operations within React components.
- Ensure that a component responds only to the most recent user input.

## Getting Started:

The starter code provides the basic setup of a React component with a form. Your task is to complete the implementation by following these steps:

1. Implement the `useLatestFormSubmission` custom hook that tracks the latest form submission and updates the form state only if the current submission is the latest.
2. Use the `useState` hook in `FormComponent` to manage the input state.
3. Handle the form submission in `FormComponent` by calling the `handleSubmit` function from your custom hook.
4. Ensure the form input is cleared after each submission.
5. Display the latest valid submission data below the form.

## User Stories:

- As a user, I should be able to type into the form and submit it.
- As a user, I expect only the latest submission to be displayed, even if older submissions finish processing later due to network delays.
- As a user, I should see the form input clear itself after each submission.

## Tips:

- Remember to use `useRef` to track the timestamp of the latest submission. This reference will help you determine whether the response received corresponds to the latest request made.
- Use `setTimeout` to simulate network latency in your `handleSubmit` function.
- Ensure your UI properly reflects the state changes by conditionally rendering the latest submission data.

## Stretch Goals:

- Enhance the form by adding validation logic to check the input before submission.
- Implement a visual indicator (e.g., a spinner) to show that a submission is in progress.
- Extend the form to handle multiple fields, adjusting the custom hook to manage more complex state.
- Add unit tests to ensure your form behaves correctly under various conditions, including rapid successive submissions.

## Notes:

- This kata focuses on functional components and modern React hooks. Avoid using class components or lifecycle methods to solve the exercise.
- Consider edge cases such as rapid successive clicks on the submit button and how your application should handle them.

By completing this kata, you will gain a deeper understanding of handling asynchronous operations in React applications, ensuring a robust and user-friendly form submission experience. Happy coding!
