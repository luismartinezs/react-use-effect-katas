# Managing API Call Race Conditions in React

Welcome to the "Managing API Call Race Conditions in React" kata! This exercise is designed to help you understand and handle race conditions that can occur when making asynchronous API calls in a React application.

In this kata, you will build a search interface that fetches and displays data based on user input. The challenge is to ensure that the responses from these API calls do not result in race conditions, which can happen if a previous API call finishes after a more recent one.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand and prevent race conditions in API calls.
- Use the `AbortController` to cancel obsolete fetch requests.
- Manage component state and side effects with `useState` and `useEffect` hooks in React.

## Getting Started:

The starter code provides the basic setup of a React component. Your task is to complete the component by implementing the following features:

1. Implement the `fetchData` function that simulates an API call with a random delay.
2. Use the `AbortController` to cancel the fetch request when a new request is made or the component is unmounted.
3. Update the component state based on the API call results or errors.
4. Ensure that the UI correctly reflects the state of data fetching, including loading and error states.

## User Stories:

- As a user, I should be able to type into the search input and trigger a data fetch based on my input.
- As a user, I should see a loading indicator when data is being fetched.
- As a user, I should see the fetched data displayed once it is available.
- As a user, I should not experience any inconsistencies in the displayed data due to race conditions from rapid input changes.
- As a user, I should see an error message if the data fetch fails for reasons other than an aborted fetch.

## Tips:

- Use the `useState` hook to manage the query, data, loading, and error states.
- Use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects related to data fetching.
- Remember to clean up ongoing fetches using the `AbortController` to prevent memory leaks and race conditions.
- Consider debouncing the input to reduce the number of API calls made while typing.

## Stretch Goals:

- Implement a debouncing mechanism to delay the API call until the user has stopped typing for a specific duration.
- Enhance the UI with better styling and animations for loading and transitions.
- Add more complex error handling scenarios and display appropriate messages for different types of errors.

## Notes:

- This kata focuses on handling race conditions, a common issue in real-world applications where user interactions can trigger rapid and overlapping data requests.
- Understanding how to cancel obsolete requests and manage state correctly in these scenarios is crucial for building robust and user-friendly interfaces.
