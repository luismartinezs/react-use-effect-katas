# Preventing Re-renders with React.useMemo

Welcome to the Preventing Re-renders with React.useMemo kata! In this exercise, you will learn how to optimize your React components by preventing unnecessary re-renders using the `useMemo` hook. By memoizing expensive computations, you can improve the performance of your React applications.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand how to use the `useMemo` hook to memoize values in React components.
- Learn how to optimize components by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- Practice updating a memoized value based on dependencies.
- Gain insight into improving performance in React applications.

## Getting Started:

The starter code provides a component `ComplexValueComponent` that contains a count state and a memoized complex value based on the count. Your task is to complete the component by implementing the following features:

1. Memoize the `complexValue` calculation using the `useMemo` hook.
2. Update the `complexValue` only when the `count` state changes.
3. Display the current count and the computed complex value in the component.
4. Implement a button that increments the count state to observe the memoization in action.

## User Stories:

- As a user, I should see the current count displayed in the component.
- As a user, I should see the computed complex value based on the count.
- As a user, I should be able to increment the count and observe the computed value update without unnecessary re-renders.

## Tips:

- Use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the expensive computation of the `complexValue`.
- Pass the dependencies array to `useMemo` to trigger recalculation only when necessary.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing values that do not change frequently.
- Test the behavior by observing the component re-renders in the browser's developer tools.

## Stretch Goals:

- Implement a decrement button to decrease the count and observe the memoization.
- Add additional state variables and memoized values to practice optimizing multiple computations.
- Explore using `useCallback` in combination with `useMemo` for more advanced optimizations.
- Refactor the component to use a custom hook for memoization and state management.

## Notes:

- Memoization is a powerful technique to optimize performance in React applications by caching expensive computations.
- Understanding when and how to use `useMemo` effectively can lead to significant improvements in rendering performance.
- Experiment with different scenarios and dependencies to grasp the impact of memoization on your components.

Happy coding, and enjoy optimizing your React components with `useMemo`!
